## Basic Knowledge
• <strong>Serial Communication</strong>

Basically, a device can be communicated with other devices either wirelessly or by cable. Communication between commonly used hardware is ``` Serial Communication ```. It can be known that there are three types of ``` Serial Communication ```, which include: ``` UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) ```, ``` SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) ```, and ``` I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) ```. ``` I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) ``` is a two-way serial communication standard that uses two channels to send data ``` (OUTPUT from Master to Slave) ``` and receive data ``` (INPUT from Slave to Master) ```. I2C uses two bidirectional lines: ``` Serial Data (SDA) ``` and ``` Serial Clock (SCL) ``` to transfer data and synchronize communication between devices. Each device connected to the ``` I2C bus ``` has a unique address that identifies it during communication. The ``` I2C protocol ``` allows multiple devices to share the same bus, and each device can act as a ``` master ``` or a ``` slave ```. ``` Master ``` is the primary device that has full authority over the control of the Slave, while the ``` Slave ``` is the secondary device that is under the authority of the Master device.<br><br>

• <strong>Internet of Things</strong>

Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept where things connected to a network can perform one or more actions in achieving a goal. These actions include data collection, data transmission, data reception, or data processing. Every IoT project requires devices that can connect to WiFi such as ESP. ESP consists of 2 types, namely ESP8266 and ESP32. This is on the market very diverse models, for that you need to readjust to the needs in the project so as not to cause disappointment.

## CH340-ESP01 USB Setup
<img width="840" src="https://github.com/devancakra/Whatsapp-Bot-based-Automatic-Fish-Monitoring-Feeding-System-using-I2C-communication-protocol/assets/54527592/a09121f7-c560-417f-890f-b683f8cf9540" alt="pinout"><br><br><br>

1. ``` Programming Mode ``` :
      
   • Attach the ``` ESP-01 ``` to the ``` CH340-ESP01 USB ```.

   • Press and hold the button on the ``` CH340-ESP01 USB ```, and plug it into computer/laptop.
   
   • Release the button when the device is recognized by the computer/laptop.
   
   • Please ``` upload ``` the program.<br><br><br>
   
2. ``` Operating Mode ``` :
   
   • Disconnect the ``` CH340-ESP01 USB ``` from the computer/laptop.

   • Do the wiring as shown in the pictorial diagram.
   
   • The program code that has been embedded in this ``` ESP-01 board ``` is ready for operation (no more programming activities).<br><br><br>

<strong>Notes :</strong>

<table><tr><td width="840">
   
   • To upload the program, besides using the ``` CH340-ESP01 USB ```, you can also use other programming tools such as: ``` CP2102 USB ```, ``` CH340 USB ```, ``` FTDI USB ```, or with ``` PL2303 USB ```.

   • Based on experience, I admit that using the ``` CH340-ESP01 USB ``` is much better than other programming tools because it does not require a cable to be connected to a computer/laptop.
